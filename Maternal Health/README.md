#### **INTRODUCTION**

The objective of this project was to determine the relationship between maternal fat measurements obtained through ultrasound and nutritional assessments, and their impact on gestational outcomes.

### **PROJECT**


This dataset was collected during a prospective study that examined the relationship between ultrasound measurements of maternal abdominal fat tissues and the outcomes during labor and delivery hospitalization.
Initially, 272 patients were enrolled in the study, but 61 (22%) were lost to follow-up, leaving a final sample of 211 cases.
At the outset, all participants underwent a routine obstetric ultrasound to measure maternal epigastric fat. This assessment included two types of measurements: maternal epigastric visceral adipose tissue (preperitoneal m-VAT) and maternal epigastric subcutaneous adipose tissue (preperitoneal m-SAT). For cases enrolled before 20 weeks, an additional assessment of periumbilical fat was conducted, which included periumbilical maternal visceral adipose tissue (periumbilical m-VAT) and periumbilical maternal subcutaneous adipose tissue (periumbilical m-SAT). Baseline data on anthropometric, nutritional, and demographic characteristics were recorded. Pregnancy outcomes were determined through review of hospital charts, focusing on pregnancy progression, labor conditions, and newborn health.
